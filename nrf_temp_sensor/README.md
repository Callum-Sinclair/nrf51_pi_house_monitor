# nRF51 Temparature Sensing Module

This section of the project contains the code for the wirless tempartaure sensing modules.

The module's hardware will be designed as part of the project, and will consist of an nRF51 chip connected to a temparature sensor. The tempartature sensor will be connected to the ADC on the nRF51. The module will be powered by a coin cell. Several of these modules will interface with a nRF51 chip connected to the Pi.
