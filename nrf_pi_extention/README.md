# nRF51 Central Communication Node

This section of the project contains the code for the nRF51 wireless communication module that interfaces with the Pi.

The module consists of an nRF51 chip connected via SPI to the Pi. The module communicates with each temparature sensor, providing this data to the Pi. The aim is to design this as a generic 2.4 GHz communication front end to the Pi, for use in low data rate applications.
