# nrf51_pi_house_monitor
Designing a home temperature monitoring system running on a Raspberry Pi using nrf51 chips for 2.4 GHz wireless data transfer

The system is in three basic parts:
- Code for the Pi
- Code for the temparature sensing modules (running on nRF51 chips)
- Code running on an nRF51 chip to communicate with the Pi (via SPI) and each temparature sensing module

This project is being completed in connection with a final year module in my Electronics and Electrical Engineering MEng degree at the University of Glasgow. This project is to be completed by June 2016 and is joint work with Tamas Lukacs and myself.
